- by creating a new offer, check if the offer has already been created before (but which vars should be checked for this routine?)
- make the offers sort by last name by default, but make sure first make the string .toLowerCase() to provide accurate sorting
- if no ownerId is set, ervery not logged in user can view these offers (something wrong with publications.js?)

NEXT STEPS
- worked through ch.8 up to now.
